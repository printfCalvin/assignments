**q5**
Question: Is the minimum value of MSE unique(i.e. there exits two different complexicities that MSE are minimum)?

Answer: True.

Explanation: $MSE = [Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))]^2 + Var(\hat{f}(x_0)) + Var(\epsilon)$. The bias decreases as complexity increases, since it becomes more and more close to the value of $y$. In addition, the variance increases as complexity increases, since the model follows the error/noise too closely. Since $Var(\epsilon)$ is constant, there minimum value of MSE is unique.
