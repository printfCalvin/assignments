***Q3***
```{r}
gra_growth = c(0.2,0.1,0.4,0.3,0.3,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.2,0.1,0.3,0.3,0.2)
liq_growth = c(0.5,0.5,0.4,0.3,0.6,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.1,0.5,0.7,0.5,0.3,0.6)
summary(lm(gra_growth - liq_growth ~ 1))
```
Where $\mu_d = \mu_g - \mu_l$  
$H_0: \mu_d < 0$ vs $H_a: \mu_d \geq 0$  
$d = \frac {-0.25 - 0} {0.1871} = 1.336184$ where $D \sim t_{13}$  
```{r}
1 - pt(-0.25 / 0.1871, 13)
```
$P(D > d) = 0.8977959$  
Hence we have no evidence reject $H_0$. Liquid fertilizer results in greater growth than granular fertilizer.
